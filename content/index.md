👋 Hey there! I’m a front-end developer based in Hangzhou, running on caffeine and code.
I love writing TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go — different languages, same passion.
Every line I write feels like building a tiny universe of my own.


I enjoy turning ideas into code —
      from random little tools to projects that might just change the world.
      If it can be coded, I’ll probably try it.

After work, my life switches from frontend to front-running —
      I debug my thoughts while running,
      tune my mood while playing guitar,
      capture life’s bugs through my camera,
      and edit time itself while cutting videos.

My idol is antfu,
      and my goal is to write code that’s just as elegant, reusable,
      and makes people say, “Wait… you can actually do that?”

If you’re in Hangzhou too,
      let’s grab a coffee sometime —
      we can talk about code, creativity,
      or the next commit that might change the world.
