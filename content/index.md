# 青椒肉丝

👋 Hey there! I'm a **front-end developer** based in Hangzhou, running on caffeine and code.
I am `青椒肉丝`, and some people call me `肉丝哥`; you can call me that too.

I love writing `TypeScript`, `JavaScript`, and `Go` — different languages, same passion. Every line I write feels like building a tiny universe of my own.

I enjoy turning ideas into code — from random little tools to projects that might just change the world. If it can be coded, I'll probably try it.

After work, my life switches from frontend to front-running:
- I debug my thoughts while **running** 🏃
- Tune my mood while playing **guitar** 🎸 
- Capture life's bugs through my **camera** 📷
- Edit time itself while cutting **videos** 🎬

My idol is [antfu](https://antfu.me), and my goal is to write code that's just as elegant, reusable, and makes people say, *"Wait… you can actually do that?"*

If you're in Hangzhou too, let's grab a coffee sometime ☕  
We can talk about code, creativity, or the next commit that might change the world.
